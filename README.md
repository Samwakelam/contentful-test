# contentful-test

A Repository to test the payloads from contentful

# Contentful Test

The purpose of this mini project is to demonstrate and test the knowledge within the team on Contentful integration using the three different SDK.

- [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js)
- Contentful App SDK
- React SDK

## Steps

### 1. Init

I have set up a turbo repo to manage workspaces including 2 `apps/` directories to house contentful apps.

- `contentful-app` will house the trial to build a Contentful app using the sdk.
- `web-app` will replicate a hosted website where the content comes from contentful. This will run on localhost:3001

I have tested that my env variables can be received by the server side props in the next js application.
